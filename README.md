The customer goals of this website are:

if you want to keep it traditional playing, such a classic game flappy bird is a game where you can get competitive with your friends and also pass the time.

UX
this game is for all people, with all backgrounds and languages, is a traditional game that uses loops and ctx to allow movements and animations, also it has incorporated sound to make it as similar to the original game as possible, the whole plan of the this game is not to make it unique I tried to replicate this classic game that I really enjoyed playing when I was from a young age. I got extremely competitive with my friends. so, I decided to bring back to life this game that I really enjoyed. FLAPPY BIRD. 

Wireframe mock-ups:
FLAPPY BIRD, is game that uses the click or tap on smart phone to work. every time you click or tap the bird moves up. When you stop clicking or tapping the bird will drop. If you do not do anything the bird will crash and the whole game will restart. Equally if you touch a pipe you will lose and you will start again. the game would automatically start once you crash. 


Features to Implement in future
would be to be able to customise the bird, pipes and background to make is a personal as possible, for me to achieve that I would need to buy the images, also I would like to have some background music maybe liking it to Spotify so that the costumer can listen to any music that they wish to use, so that it keeps them motivated. Also use python to create accounts and create a separate page where the scores would be posted. so that people can see the highest scores and get a community building up around this game.
